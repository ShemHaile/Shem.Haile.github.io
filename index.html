        <h3 id="Y">Why do we need Campaign Finance Reform?</h3>
        <p class="reform-text">Campaign finance reform is crucial in the United States to uphold the principles of
          democracy and ensure fair representation of all citizens. Currently, the influence of money in politics allows
          wealthy individuals, corporations, and special interest groups to wield disproportionate power over elections
          and policymaking. This undermines the democratic process by potentially silencing the voices of ordinary
          citizens and distorting policy priorities in favor of those with financial resources. Reforming campaign
          finance laws is essential to promote transparency, reduce corruption, and restore public trust in government
          institutions. By establishing stricter regulations on campaign donations, limiting the influence of dark
          money, and enhancing disclosure requirements, the United States can move towards a more equitable electoral
          system where political decisions reflect the will and interests of the broader populace.</p>

        <h3 id="a">What we can do going forward</h3>
        <p>To pressure the government to enact campaign finance reform, citizens can engage in various forms of advocacy
          and activism. First and foremost, organizing grassroots movements and participating in peaceful protests can
          amplify public awareness and demonstrate widespread support for reform. Contacting elected representatives
          through letters, emails, and phone calls to express concerns and demand action on campaign finance reform is
          also effective. Furthermore, supporting organizations dedicated to electoral transparency and reform, and
          staying informed about candidates' stances on campaign finance issues, enables voters to make informed choices
          at the ballot box. By collectively advocating for legislative changes that curb the influence of money in
          politics, citizens can play a pivotal role in encouraging the government to prioritize and implement
          meaningful campaign finance reform.</p>
